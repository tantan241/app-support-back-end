Margaret Dorrance. Disc 1 shows Tom teaching how to develop a better understanding of his three major principles of horsemanship, Feel Timing and Balance. With his direction and support, it is easy to see how the horse and rider begin to make positive changes. There is a huge amount of information given from Tom as he explains different ways of approaching the horse to get the job done. Although we show the rider working on specifics, straightness, starting or stopping with good engagement, and much more; the important element to appreciate is what Tom says and how he teaches the rider to help direct and support the horse. Because this is the key to so much more. Disc 2 starts with a little biography of Tom as he talks about his earlier days and his family. This transitions well into an in depth discussion of his bestselling book \'True Unity\', where Tom, for the first time on film, expands on some of the deeper and finer points he makes within the book.
